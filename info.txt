here when we vectorize the tags and ready to work on new_df

now we need to find the relation and to find the relation between those two rows we 
1. combine all the tags
2. find the most common words appearing 
3. find count of each word in every tag 
4. compare the count of those word with other tag 
5. also we need to choose less word to find best approach
6. also we don't need stop word 
7. now we need to calculate the distance between those vector 
8. cosin distance calculate mean angle between two vector
